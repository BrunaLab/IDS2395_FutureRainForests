#### TEXT 11: Thomas Moore, [*Utopia*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2130/2130-h/2130-h.htm) (1516)

> Under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as the sun moves,
> there lay vast deserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of
> the sun; the soil was withered, all things looked dismally, and all
> places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and
> serpents, and some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel
> than the beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a new scene
> opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more
> verdant, and even the beasts were less wild: and, at last, there were
> nations, towns, and cities, that had not only mutual commerce among
> themselves and with their neighbours, but traded, both by sea and
> land, to very remote countries.

#### TEXT 12: John Milton, *Paradise Lost* (1667)

> So on he fares, and to the border comes\
> Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,\
> Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,\
> As with a rural mound, the champaign head\
> Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides\
> With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,\
> Access denied; and overhead upgrew\
> Insuperable height of loftiest shade,\
> Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,\
> A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,\
> Shade above shade, a woody theatre\
> Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops\
> The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;\
> Which to our general sire gave prospect large\
> Into his nether empire neighbouring round.\
> And higher than that wall a circling row\
> Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,\
> Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,\
> Appeared

#### TEXT 13: Rudyard Kipling, [*Jungle Book*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35997/35997-h/35997-h.htm) (1894)

> "Listen, man-cub," said the bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder
> on a hot night. "I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all
> the Peoples of the Jungle---except the Monkey Folk who live in the
> trees. They have no Law. They are outcastes. They have no speech of
> their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they
> listen and peep and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not
> our way. They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They
> boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do
> great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their
> minds to laughter, and all is forgotten. We of the jungle have no
> dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not
> go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die
> where they die."

#### TEXT 14: Rudyard Kipling, [*Second Jungle Book*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1937) (1894)

*EB Karela is bitter melon (_Momordica charantia_)*

> MOWGLI'S SONG AGAINST PEOPLE

> I will let loose against you the fleet-footed vines---\
> I will call in the Jungle to stamp out your lines!\
> The roofs shall fade before it,\
> The house-beams shall fall,\
> And the Karela\*, the bitter Karela,\
> Shall cover it all!

> In the gates of these your councils my people shall sing,\
> In the doors of these your garners the Bat-folk shall cling;\
> And the snake shall be your watchman,\
> By a hearthstone unswept;\
> For the Karela, the bitter Karela,\
> Shall fruit where ye slept!

> Ye shall not see my strikers; ye shall hear them and guess;\
> By night, before the moon-rise, I will send for my cess,\
> And the wolf shall be your herdsman\
> By a landmark removed,\
> For the Karela, the bitter Karela,\
> Shall seed where ye loved!

> I will reap your fields before you at the hands of a host;\
> Ye shall glean behind my reapers, for the bread that is lost,\
> And the deer shall be your oxen\
> By a headland untilled,\
> For the Karela, the bitter Karela,\
> Shall leaf where ye build!

> I have untied against you the club-footed vines,\
> I have sent in the Jungle to swamp out your lines.\
> The trees---the trees are on you!\
> The house-beams shall fall,\
> And the Karela, the bitter Karela,\
> Shall cover you all!


#### TEXT 15: Rudyard Kipling, *White Man's Burden* (1899)

> Take up the White Man's burden\
> Send forth the best ye breed\
> Go bind your sons to exile\
> To serve your captives' need;\
> To wait in heavy harness,\
> On fluttered folk and wild\
> Your new-caught, sullen peoples,\
> Half-devil and half-child

#### TEXT 16: O. Henry, [*Cabbages and Kings*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2777/2777-h/2777-h.htm) (1905)

> Well, then, in three days we sailed alongside that Guatemala...We
> landed at a town on the coast, where a train of cars was waitin' for
> us on a dinky little railroad.....We run some forty miles in seven
> hours, and the train stopped. There was no more railroad. 'Twas a sort
> of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies. They was
> gradin' and choppin' out the forests ahead to continue the road.
> 'Here,' says I to myself, 'is the romantic haunt of the
> revolutionists. Here will Clancy, by the virtue that is in a superior
> race and the inculcation of Fenian tactics, strike a tremendous blow
> for liberty. The trees was all sky-scrapers; the underbrush was full
> of needles and pins; there was monkeys jumpin' around and crocodiles
> and pink-tailed mockin'-birds, and ye stood knee-deep in the rotten
> water and grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala. Of nights we
> would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes, and sit in
> the smoke, with the guards pacin' all around us.

> One old man named Halloran --- a man of Hibernian entitlements and
> discretions, explained it to me. He had been workin' on the road a
> year. Most of them died in less than six months. He was dried up to
> gristle and bone, and shook with chills every third night. "Ye're
> surrounded by a ragin' forest full of disreputable beasts---lions and
> baboons and anacondas---waitin' to devour ye. The sun strikes ye hard,
> and melts the marrow in your bones...The fault's wid these tropics.
> They rejuices a man's system. 'Tis a land, as the poet says, 'Where it
> always seems to be after dinner'."

#### TEXT 17: James S Gilbert, *Beyond the Chagres River* (1905)

*[EB: The Chagres River is in central Panama. It is the largest river in the Panama Canal's watershed and is dammed twice. The resulting reservoirs — Gatun Lake and Lake Alajuela — form an integral part of the Panama Canal and its water system.]*

> Beyond the Chagres River,\
> 'Tis said (the story's old),\
> Are paths that lead to mountains\
> Of purest virgin gold;\
> But 'tis my firm conviction\
> Whate'er the tales they tell\
> Beyond the Chagres River\
> All paths lead straight to Hell.

#### TEXT 18: Edgar Rice Burroughs [*Tarzan of the Apes*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/78/78-h/78-h.htm) (1912)

> Their work done the sailors returned to the small boat, and pulled off
> rapidly toward the Arrow. Tarzan, an interested spectator of all that
> had taken place, sat speculating on the strange actions of these
> peculiar creatures. Men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than
> the beasts of the jungle! How fortunate was he who lived in the peace
> and security of the great forest!

#### TEXT 19: Joseph Conrad, [*Heart of Darkness*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/219/219-h/219-h.htm) (1967)

> It was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to
> the bank below Kurtz's station. Going up that river was like traveling
> back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted
> on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great
> silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy,
> sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long
> stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of
> overshadowed distances...The broadening waters flowed through a mob of
> wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a
> desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the
> channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from
> everything you had known once somewhere far away --- in another
> existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to
> one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for
> yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream,
> remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this
> strange world of plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of
> life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an
> implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at
> you with a vengeful aspect...

> ...I tried to break the spell---the heavy, mute spell of the
> wilderness that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
> awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of
> gratified and monstrous passions.

<!-- #### Norman Mailer, *The Naked and the Dead* (1948) -->

#### TEXT 20: Gabriel García Márquez, *One Hundred Years of Solitude* (1967)

> Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The
> ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was
> thicker and thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the
> monkeys became more and more remote, and the world became eternally
> sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient
> memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to
> before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil
> and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders.

#### TEXT 21: Elizabeth Gilbert, *Eat, Pray, Love* (2006)

> So I take a taxi to the town of Ubud, which seems like a good place to
> start my journey. I check into a small and pretty hotel there on the
> fabulously named Monkey Forest Road. The hotel has a sweet swimming
> pool and a garden crammed with tropical flowers with blossoms bigger
> than volleyballs (tended to by a highly organized team of hummingbirds
> and butterflies). The staff is Balinese, which means they
> automatically start adoring you and complimenting you on your beauty
> as soon as you walk in. The room has a view of the tropical treetops
> and there's a breakfast included every morning with piles of fresh
> tropical fruit. In short, it's one of the nicest places I've ever
> stayed and it's costing me less than ten dollars a day. It's good to
> be back.

> The sound universe is also spectacular around here. In the evenings
> there's a cricket orchestra with frogs providing the bass line. In the
> dead of night the dogs howl about how misunderstood they are. Before
> dawn the roosters for miles around announce how freaking cool it is to
> be roosters. ("We are ROOSTERS!" they holler. "We are the only ones
> who get to be ROOSTERS!") Every morning around sunrise there is a
> tropical birdsong competition, and it's always a ten-way tie for the
> championship. When the sun comes out the place quiets down and the
> butterflies get to work. The whole house is covered with vines; I feel
> like any day it will disappear into the foliage completely and I will
> disappear with it and become a jungle flower myself. The rent is less
> than what I used to pay in New York City for taxi fare every month.

> I rode my bicycle back home, pushing my happy body up the hills toward
> my house in the late afternoon sun. On my way through the forest, a
> big male monkey dropped out of a tree right in front of me and bared
> his fangs at me. I didn't even flinch. I said, "Back off, Jack---I got
> four brothers protecting my ass," and I just rode right on by him.
